## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd neet-college-predictor
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Train the Model
```bash
python train_model.py
```
This will generate historical data and train the college prediction model.
